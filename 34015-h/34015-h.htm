PREFACE
</H3>

<P>
One who after writing prose all his life suddenly essays to launch a
volume of verse, must know something of the feeling with which an
old-time sailor after coasting only his native shores found himself
setting sail into an unknown sea.
</P>

<P>
The author of this little volume knows quite as well as the most
experienced mariner the temerity of sailing an untried main in so frail
a bark.  But he is willing, if the Fates so decree, to go down with the
unnumbered sail of that great fleet which have throughout the ages
faced the wide ocean of oblivion, merely for the thrill of being for a
brief space on its vast waters.
</P>

<P>
Since Horace, secure in the double endowment of genius and of an
Emperor's favor, wrote scornfully how hated of gods and men was
middling verse, no one has ever doubted the fact&mdash;perhaps, not even one
of all the myriads who have dared to brave that bitter scorn.  The
explanation then for the production of so much of the despised matter
must be that there is for the minor poet also a music that the outer
world does not catch&mdash;an inner day which the outer world does not see.
It is this music, this light which, for the most part, is for the
lesser poet his only reward.  That he has heard, however brokenly, and
at however vast a distance, snatches of those strains which thrilled
the souls of Marlowe and Milton and Keats and Shelley, even though he
may never reproduce one of them, is moreover a sufficiently high reward.

<P CLASS="poem">
As one who wanders in a lonely land,<BR>
Through all the blackness of a stormy night,<BR>
Now stumbling here, now falling there outright,<BR>
And doubts if it be worse to stir or stand,<BR>
Not knowing what abysses yawn at hand,<BR>
What torrents roar beyond some beetling height;<BR>
Yet scales the top to find the dawn in sight,<BR>
And Earth kissed into radiance with its wand:<BR>
So, wandering hopeless in the darkness, I,<BR>
Scarce recking whither led my painful way,<BR>
Or whether I should faint or strive to prove<BR>
If 'yond the mountain-top some path might lie,<BR>
Climbed boldly up the steep, and lo! the Day<BR>
Broke into pearl and splendor in thy love.<BR>

THE COAST OF BOHEMIA<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
There is a land not charted on all charts;<BR>
Though many mariners have touched its coast,<BR>
Who far adventuring in those distant parts,<BR>
Meet ship-wreck there and are forever lost;<BR>
Or if they e'er return, are soon once more<BR>
Borne far away by hunger for that magic shore.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Its mystic mountains on the horizon piled,<BR>
Some mariners have glimpsed when driven far<BR>
Out of life's measured course by tempests wild,<BR>
Or lured therefrom by the erratic star<BR>
They chose as pilot, till their errant guide<BR>
Drew them resistlessly within its witching tide.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For oft, they tell, who know its sapphire strand<BR>
The golden haze enfolding it hangs low,<BR>
And those who careless steer may miss the land,<BR>
Embosomed in the sunset's purple glow,<BR>
Its lights mistaken for the evening stars,<BR>
Its music for the surf-beat on its golden bars.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Young Jason found it when he dauntless sought<BR>
The golden fleece by Colchis' perilous stream,<BR>
And in his track full many an argonaut<BR>
Hath found the rare fleece of his golden dream,<BR>
And at the last, Ulysses-like, surcease<BR>
From Sorrow's dole and Labor's heavy prease.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
One voyager charted it for every age,<BR>
From azure rim to starry mountain core.<BR>
A nameless player on the World's great stage,<BR>
He spread his sails, adventured to that shore<BR>
And reared a pharos with his art sublime,<BR>
Like Ilion's song-wrought towers, to beacon every clime.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The great adventurers reached it when they brake<BR>
Columbus-led into the unknown West,<BR>
And those who followed in their shining wake,<BR>
But left no trace of where their keels have pressed;<BR>
Yet have through stress of storm and tempests' rage<BR>
Won by his quenchless light a happy anchorage.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There rest the heroes of lost causes lorn,<BR>
On their calm brows more fadeless chaplets far<BR>
Than all their conquerors' could e'er adorn,<BR>
When shone effulgent Fame's ascendant star;<BR>
There fallen patriots reap the glorious prize<BR>
Of deathless memory of their precious sacrifice.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There many a dream-faced maid and matron dwells,<BR>
From Argive Helen on through gliding time;<BR>
There drink the poets draughts from crystal wells,<BR>
And choir high music to their harps sublime:<BR>
And there the great philosophers discourse<BR>
Divine Philosophy in due and tranquil course.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There not alone the great and lofty sing;<BR>
But silent poets too find there the song<BR>
They only sang in dreams when wandering<BR>
Amazed and lost amid the earthly throng;<BR>
Their hearts unfettered all from worldly fears.<BR>
Attuned to meet the spacious music of the spheres:<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Gray, wrinkled men, the sea-salt in their hair,<BR>
Their eyes set deep with peering through the gloom,<BR>
Their voices low with speaking ever, where<BR>
The surges break beneath the mountains' loom;<BR>
But deep within their yearning, burning eyes<BR>
The light reflected ever from those radiant skies.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There fadeless Youth, unknowing of annoy,<BR>
Walks aye with changeless Love; and Sorrow there<BR>
Is but a memory to hallow Joy,<BR>
With chastened Happiness so deep and rare,<BR>
Well-nigh the Heart aches with its rich content,<BR>
And Hope with full fruition evermore is blent.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Constant Penelope, her web complete,<BR>
Rests there content at last and smiling down<BR>
On worn Ulysses basking at her feet;<BR>
Calm Beatrice wears joyously the crown<BR>
Bestowed by exiled Dante in his grief,<BR>
And Laura, kind, gives Petrarch's tuneful heart relief.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
'Mid bloomy meadows laved by limpid streams,<BR>
Repose the Muses and the Graces sweet;<BR>
There kiss we lips we only kissed in dreams<BR>
Meshed in the grosser world; and there we meet<BR>
The fair and flower-like lost loves of our Youth,<BR>
When unafraid we trod the ways with radiant Truth.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Those who return have pressed alone the coast;<BR>
But tell of some lost in that charmèd strond:<BR>
Aspiring souls who loving Honor most,<BR>
Have sought the crystal mountain-tops beyond,<BR>
And striven upward, heedless of their scars,<BR>
To where all paths lead ever to the shining stars.<BR>

THE VOICE OF THE SEA<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus spake to Man the thousand-throated Sea;<BR>
Words which the stealing winds caught from its lips:<BR>
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thou thinkest thee and thine, God's topmost crown.<BR>
But hearken unto me and humbly learn<BR>
How infinite thine insignificance.<BR>
Thou boastest of thine age&mdash;thy works&mdash;thyself:<BR>
Thine oldest monuments of which thou prat'st<BR>
Were built but yesterday when measured by<BR>
Yon snow-domed mountains of eternal rock:<BR>
The Earth, thy mother, from whose breast thou draw'st,<BR>
The sweat-stained living which she wills to give,<BR>
And in whose dust thine own must melt again,<BR>
Was agèd cycles ere thine earliest dawn;&mdash;<BR>
But they to me are young: I gave them birth.<BR>
Climb up those heaven-tipt peaks thy dizziest height,<BR>
Thou there shalt read, graved deep, my name and age;<BR>
Dig down thy deepest depth, shalt read them still.<BR>
Before the mountains sprang, before the Earth,<BR>
Thy cradle and thy tomb, was made, I was:<BR>
God called them forth from me, as thee from Earth.<BR>
Thou burrow'st through a mountain, here and there,<BR>
Work'st all thine engines, cutting off a speck;<BR>
I wash their rock-foundations under; tear<BR>
Turret from turret, toppling thundering down,<BR>
And crush their mightiest fragments into sand:<BR>
Thou gravest with thy records slab and spar,<BR>
And callest them memorials of thy Might;&mdash;<BR>
Lo! not a stone exists, from yon black cliff<BR>
To that small pebble at thy foot, but bears<BR>
My signature graved there when Earth was young,<BR>
To teach the mighty wonders of the Deep.<BR>
Thy deeds&mdash;thyself&mdash;are what?  A morning mist!<BR>
But I!  I face the ages.  Dost not know<BR>
That as I gave the Earth to spread her fair<BR>
And dew-washed body in the morning light,<BR>
So, still, 't is I that keep her fair and fresh?&mdash;<BR>
That weave her robes and nightly diamond them?<BR>
I fill her odorous bowers with perfumes rare;<BR>
Strew field and forest with bee-haunted stars;<BR>
I give the Morn pearl for her radiant roof,<BR>
And Eve lend glory for her rosy dome;<BR>
I build the purple towers that hold the West<BR>
And guard the passage of Retiring Day.<BR>
Thy frailest fabric far outlasts thyself:<BR>
The pyramids rise from the desert sands,<BR>
Their builders blown in dust about their feet.<BR>
The winged bull looms mid an alien race,<BR>
Grim, silent, lone.  But whither went the King?<BR>
I cool the lambent air upon my breast,<BR>
And send the winds forth on mine embassies;<BR>
I offer all my body to the Sun,<BR>
And lade our caravans with merchandise,<BR>
To carry wealth and plenty to all climes.<BR>
Yon fleecy continents of floating snow,<BR>
That dwarf the mountains over which they sail,<BR>
Are but my bales borne by my messengers,<BR>
To cheer and gladden every thirsty land.<BR>
The Arab by his palm-girt desert pool,<BR>
The Laplander above his frozen rill,<BR>
The Woodsman crouched beside his forest brook,<BR>
The shepherd mirrored in his upland spring,<BR>
Drink of my cup in one great brotherhood.<BR>
'T is, nay, not man alone&mdash;thou art but one<BR>
Of all the myriads of life-holding things,&mdash;<BR>
Brute, beast, bird, reptile, insect, thing unnamed,<BR>
Whose souls find recreation in my breath:<BR>
Nay, not a tree, flower, sprig of grass or weed,<BR>
But lives through me and hymns my praise to God:<BR>
I feed, sustain, refresh and keep them all:<BR>
Mirror and type of God that giveth life.<BR>
I sing as softly as a mother croons<BR>
Her drowsy babe to sleep upon her breast.<BR>
On quiet nights when all my winds are laid,<BR>
I wile the stars down from their azure home<BR>
To sink with golden footprints in my depths:<BR>
I show the silvered pathway to the moon,<BR>
All paved with gems the errant Pleiad lost,<BR>
That night she strayed from her sisters wan;<BR>
But I sing other times strains from that song<BR>
Before whose awfulness my waters sank,<BR>
And at whose harmony the mountains rose,<BR>
I heard that morning when the breath of God<BR>
Moved on my face, and said, Let there be light!<BR>
I thrill and tremble since but at the thought<BR>
Of that great wonder of that greatest dawn,<BR>
When at God's word the brooding darkness rose,<BR>
Which veiled my face from all the birth of things<BR>
And rolled far frighted from its resting-place,<BR>
To bide henceforth beyond Day's crystal walls,<BR>
While all the morning stars together sang,<BR>
And on the instant God stood full revealed!<BR>

LONG ROLL AT NAPOLEON'S TOMB<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
'Twas the marble crypt where the Emperor lay,<BR>
His mighty marshals on either side,<BR>
Guarding his couch since the solemn day<BR>
France brought him home in her chastened pride,<BR>
To sleep on her heart, from the sea-girt cage<BR>
Where the Eagle pined and died in his rage.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I thought of the long, red carnival<BR>
Death held in the track of his sword, amain,<BR>
From Toulon's bloom to the crimsoned pall<BR>
He spread upon Waterloo's ripened grain;<BR>
I thought of the long black years of dread<BR>
When the nations quaked at his armies' tread.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A-sudden above as the twilight fell<BR>
The deathly silence around was shocked<BR>
By the roll of a drum.  At the throbbing swell<BR>
The vaulted dome of the Heavens rocked,<BR>
Till it seemed that the mighty conqueror's soul<BR>
Was shaking the earth in that drum's long roll.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In the purple glooming the spell was wrought;<BR>
And forth from their tomb the legions sprang:<BR>
A Cadmus-brood of a Master's thought;<BR>
The long-roll beat and the bugles sang;<BR>
The tattered standards again unfurled,<BR>
And Napoleon once more bestrid the world.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I heard that instant the self-same drum<BR>
Which beat at his call when France arose<BR>
From her ashes and blood when he bade her come<BR>
In Liberty's name to face her foes;<BR>
I saw her invincible armies arise,<BR>
The light of Liberty in their eyes.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O'er Tyranny's pyre her standards flew;<BR>
I felt the thrill of the new-born life:<BR>
As cleansed from Terror, France the true,<BR>

At the living voice of her own first-born.<BR>

And his Empire melted away in flame:<BR>

THE PRINCESS' PROGRESS<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Across the dusky land<BR>
The Gracious Goddess, Spring,<BR>
In vernal robes arrayed,<BR>
Last night her royal progress made,<BR>
Scattering with lavish hand<BR>
Her fragrant blossoming.<BR>
Along the wold,<BR>
In spendthrift glee,<BR>
She strewed her gold<BR>
And gilded all the lea.<BR>
The dandelions' yellow coin<BR>
Lie scattered in the tangled grass,<BR>
And buttercup and crocus join<BR>
To tell the way she chose to pass.<BR>
In lavish wealth the gleaming daffodil<BR>
Shines on the cloudy April hill,<BR>
And many a yellow marigold<BR>
Marks where her brazen chariot rolled;<BR>
The slender-necked narcissus bends<BR>
His dewy head, and leaning down,<BR>
Looks deep to find within a dew-drop's lens<BR>
A mirrowing pool where Love may drown.<BR>
No cranny deep nor nook<BR>
But felt her tender look;<BR>
No secret leafy place<BR>
But warmed before her face<BR>
And blossomed with her grace.<BR>
The woodland, sombre yesterday,<BR>
Hath in her presence donned a brave array,<BR>
And in a night grown gay.<BR>
Her purple cloak, all careless flung,<BR>
Upon the red-bud hung;<BR>
And on the forest trees,<BR>
Her richest laceries.<BR>
While sprinkled deep with dust of gold<BR>
The tender, flowery branches hold<BR>
Her verdant robe blown fold on fold.<BR>
Her queenly figure clad<BR>
In broidered raiment glad,<BR>
Complete and passing sweet,<BR>
Hath set the sylvan zephyrs mad.<BR>
About her breathed rare odors sweet,<BR>
Of roses blowing neath her feet:<BR>
About her breathed sweet odors rare,<BR>
Of violets shaken from her hair,<BR>
As though unseen of mortal eyes,<BR>
She 'd jarred the gates of Paradise.<BR>
Her crystal horn in passing by she wound,<BR>
And at the witching sound,<BR>
As by the enchanter's stroke,<BR>
The fields in music broke,<BR>
And every silent grove in melody awoke.<BR>
Responsive to her charmèd lyre<BR>
The dewy-throated choir<BR>
Carol in every brake and brier,<BR>
And flood with golden song<BR>
The verdant reaches ranged along&mdash;<BR>
Where drinking deep from fountains clear<BR>
Their inspiration,<BR>
They hymn their jubilation<BR>
That Spring again is here;<BR>
And all together sing<BR>
The Goddess of the Year,<BR>
The Spring: the gracious Spring.<BR>

I once might hear the fairies sing<BR>
Upon the feathery grass a-swing,<BR>
Or in the orchard's blossoming:<BR>

Christ's teachings were her constant guide,<BR>

Christ's Death and Passion were her plea&mdash;<BR>

For that amid earth's fiercest strife<BR>
Her life was patterned on His life.<BR>

So, ever in her face<BR>
Shines Heaven's divinest grace.<BR>
Her soul is fresh and mild<BR>
As is a little child.<BR>

AN OLD IDYL OF A RICHMOND STREET-CAR<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
All up the street at a stately pace<BR>
The maiden passed with her April-face,<BR>
And the roses I 'd paid for, on her breast<BR>
Were white as the eggs in a partridge-nest,<BR>
While behind her&mdash;driver upon his stool&mdash;<BR>
Tinkled the bell of the street-car mule.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Going to walk up the street?" I said;<BR>
She graciously bowed her beautiful head.<BR>
"Then I 'll walk, too; 't is a lovely day."&mdash;<BR>
Thus I opened the ball in my usual way.<BR>
"Do you see the car anywhere?" inquired<BR>
The April-face, "I 'm a trifle tired."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I urged a walk; 'twas a useless suit!<BR>
She wildly waved her parachute;<BR>
The stub-tailed mule stopped quick enow;<BR>
I handed her in with a stately bow;<BR>
And the bell rang out with a jangled quirk,<BR>
As the stub-tailed mule went off with a jerk.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Three men as she entered solemnly rose,<BR>
And quietly trampled their neighbors' toes;<BR>
A dudish masher left his place,<BR>
And edged near the girl with the April-face,<BR>
Who sat on the side you 'd call "the lee,"<BR>
(With the same sweet smile she 'd sat on me).<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The day it was lovely; mild the air;<BR>
The sky, like the maiden's face, was fair;<BR>
The car was full, and a trifle stale<BR>
(Attached to the mule with the stubbly tail);<BR>
Yet the maiden preferred the seat she hired,<BR>
To the stroll with me; for I made her tired.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And now when the maiden walks the street<BR>
With another's flowers, and smile so sweet,<BR>

While I purchase a seat with half my pelf;<BR>
For it makes me a trifle tired myself.<BR>
